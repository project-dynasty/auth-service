In this repository we keep the current state of development of our Authentication Service. The Authentication Service is a secure web application that provides users with two-factor authentication using Google Authenticator. The project is built using Java and Spring Boot framework. We have a heap of documentation available for the code in this repository. You may be interested in...

## Requirements

- Java 11 or later
- Apache Maven 3.6.3 or later

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `mvn clean install` to build the application.
3. Start the application using `mvn spring-boot:run`.
4. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

1. Register a new user by providing a valid email address and password.
2. After successful registration, log in to the application using the registered email and password.
3. Enable two-factor authentication by scanning the QR code with the Google Authenticator app or manually entering the secret key.
4. Log out of the application and log in again using the registered email and password.
5. Enter the six-digit code generated by the Google Authenticator app when prompted.
6. The application will authenticate the user and redirect to the home page.

## Security

- Passwords are hashed using BCrypt with a randomly generated salt for each user.
- Two-factor authentication is implemented using Google Authenticator, which generates one-time passwords that expire after a short time period.
- Secret keys for two-factor authentication are generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator and stored securely in the database.
